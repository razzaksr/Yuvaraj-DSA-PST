Array's:
Two Sum
Problem Statement:
Given a list of item prices, find indices of two items whose combined price equals a customer's gift biked value.
Sample Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Expected Output:
[0, 1]
Explanation: The items at index 0 and 1 add up to 9 (2 + 7 = 9).

Maximum Subarray (Kadanâ€™s Algorithm)
Problem Statement:
Find the contiguous period of maximum net income from daily financial logs.
Sample Input:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Expected Output:
6
Explanation: Subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] yields the highest sum.


Move Zeroes
Problem Statement:
Rearrange a delivery queue where zeros indicate unavailable trucks; push them to the end without disrupting the rest.

	Sample Input:
	nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
	Expected Output:
	[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

	Input:
	20,0,19,5,0,3,10,0,2
	Output:
	20,19,5,3,10,2,0,0,0

	Input:
	3,0,0,1,0,5,0,6,0
	Output:
	3,1,5,6,0,0,0,0,0

Find Pivot Index
	Problem Statement:
	Determine the index at which the workload to its left equals the workload to its right.
	Sample Input:
	nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]
	Expected Output:
	3
	Explanation: 1 + 7 + 3 = 11, 5 + 6 = 11.
	Input:
	-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0
	Output:
	3
	Input:
	0,-3,5,-4,-2,3,1,0
	Output:
	0


Find Second Max:

Input: 1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6
Output: 6


Assignments:
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Problem Statement:
Identify the best day to buy and the best day to sell for highest profit from historical stock prices.
Sample Input:
	prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
	Buy at 1 and sell at 6.

	45, 12, 3, 10, 50
	Best time to buy 3 best time to sell 50

	-10, -5, -2, -1, 1
	Best time to buy -10 best time to sell 1

	90, 40, 20, 10, 4
	Best time to buy 10 best time to sell 4

		Insert Interval
		Problem Statement:
		Insert a new booking and merge overlapping intervals in an existing schedule.

		Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
		Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

		Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
		Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
		Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

	Problem Statement:
		Assume that your are part of support team in IRCTC app where customers would raise issue and it will be considered priority ticket such as 0, 1 and 2. now today tickets are in the bucket and you need to arrange it by priority
		Example:
		Input:
		2,0,0,1,0,2,0,1
		Output:
		0,0,0,0,1,1,2,2
		Sample Input:
		nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
		Expected Output:
		[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
